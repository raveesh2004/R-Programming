<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Salary Prediction project aims to provide organizations with a reliable tool for quick and informed decisions on employee compensation. By leveraging the simplicity and interpretability of Decision Trees, the project enables efficient salary predictions based on factors like experience and education. Through data exploration and preprocessing, the model facilitates a straightforward yet effective approach to estimate salaries accurately.</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>The main objective of this project is to develop a precise salary prediction model using Decision Trees in R. By considering key factors such as experience and education, the model aims to provide organizations with a streamlined and effective tool for making informed decisions on employee compensation. The project focuses on enhancing accuracy and efficiency in salary estimation through data preprocessing and the application of Decision Trees.</p>

<h2 id="r-programming-language">R Programming Language</h2>
<p>R is a powerful, open-source programming language widely used for statistical computing and data analysis. With its extensive package ecosystem and robust visualization capabilities, R is a preferred tool for data scientists and statisticians. The language's syntax is conducive to data manipulation and analysis, making it suitable for handling diverse statistical models. R's active community contributes to its continual development and ensures its relevance in the evolving field of data science.</p>

<h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset used in this project is <code>Social_Network_Ads.csv</code>. It contains information related to social network advertisements and various features such as age, estimated salary, and purchased status. The dataset is used to train and evaluate the salary prediction model.</p>

<h2 id="data-structures-in-r">Data Structures in R</h2>
<p>R provides several fundamental data structures for storing and manipulating data. This project explores the usage of vectors, matrices, data frames, lists, and factors. Each data structure has its own characteristics and functions, allowing for efficient data handling and analysis.</p>

<h2 id="linear-regression">Linear Regression</h2>
<p>Linear Regression is a statistical modeling technique used to establish a linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, Linear Regression is implemented in R to predict salaries based on relevant features. The results are visualized using scatter plots and regression lines.</p>

<h2 id="logistic-regression">Logistic Regression</h2>
<p>Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability of an event occurring based on the independent variables. In this project, Logistic Regression is applied to predict the purchased status of social network advertisements. The results are visualized using confusion matrices and ROC curves.</p>

<h2 id="decision-tree-algorithm">Decision Tree Algorithm</h2>
<p>Decision Trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. They create a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. In this project, Decision Trees are employed for salary prediction based on features such as experience and education. The resulting decision tree is visualized for better understanding and interpretation.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This salary prediction project demonstrates the application of Decision Trees in R for accurate salary estimation. By considering factors like experience and education, the model provides organizations with a reliable tool for making informed decisions on employee compensation. Through data preprocessing, visualization, and the implementation of Decision Trees, the project showcases the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing accuracy and efficiency in salary prediction.</p>
